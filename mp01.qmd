title: "Mini-Project #01: NYC Payroll Analysis"
---

#### __Executive Summary:__

The following analysis utilizes the [NYC payroll](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) data to examine payroll trends, identidy key figures within the dataset, and evaluate three potential policy proposals: (1) capping salaries at the mayoral level, (2) increasing staffing to reduce overtime expenses, and (3) implementing a performance-based pay structure. The goal is to understand potential savings, key individuals, agencies, and trends in the city's payroll system. Each policy is analyzed in terms of its financial impact, implementation feasibility, and potential issues on workforce moral and performance. 


#### __Data Collection and Preparation:__
The dataset used for this analysis derives from the NYC payroll system. This data is collected in batches using the NYC's open data platform, where: 

- __File Formate:__ The data is in CVS format, reperesenting city payroll records, including employee names, positions, salaries and compensations, and other related details. 

- __Data Processing:__ Various libraries (e.g., dplyr, jsonlite, httr2, readr, stringr, DT, and scales) are used to clean and process the data.

Key insights drawn from the data include:

- __Employee Compensation:__ Calculations of total compensation for key individuals, including salaries, ovetime pay, and other compensations. 

- __Aggregated Salaries:__ Analysis of city-wide payroll figures, employee counts, and overtime statistics. 


#### __Key Insights from NYC Payroll Data:__

* __Top Paid Individual:__ The highest city total payroll (regular salary + overtime pay)
 for a single individual is identified. 
 
* __Overtime Trends:__ The individual with the most overtime hours and the agency with the highest overtime usage are highlighted. 

* __Highest Paying Agencies:__ The agency with the highest average total payroll per employee is identified.

* __Payroll Growth:__ Over the past 10 years, the city's aggregate payroll has grown, with the trend showcasing the need for cost control measure.

#### __Policy Proposals:__


##### Policy 1: Capping Salaries at the Mayoral Level
 
* __Objective:__ Limit compensation of city employees to the mayor's total pay, as a mean to reduce government spending. 

* __Analysis:__ 
  * The mayor's salary is calculated by summing his regular pay and overtime for each fiscal year. 

  * Employees earning above the mayor's salary are identified, and their salary reduction are computed.

  * __Potential Savings:__ The total savings from implementing this policy is significant, with millions of dollars in savings identified. Agencies and job titles that would bear the brunt of the salary caps are identified. 

__Recommendation:__ While the policy could yield total savings exceed $1 million, it may affect employee morale, especially among high-level positions. Consideration should be given to alternative savings strategies that target overtime reduction. 


##### Policy 2: Increasomg Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses
* __Objectives:__ To reduce the need for overtime by increasing the number of full-time employees in key agencies. 

* __Analysis:__
  * Overtime data is analyzed across various agencies, with an estimate of the number of full-time employees needed to replace overtime. 

  * __Cost Comparison:__ The cost of overtime is compared to the potential cost of hiring full-time employees to replace overtime hours. 

  * __Savings Potential:__ Agencies with the higher overtime costs could save significant amounts by replacing overtime with regular employees. 

  * A bar graph illustrates potential savings for each agency is staffing levels were increased. 
  
__Recommendation:__ This policy has the potential for substantial savings, especial in agencies with significant overtime costs. The financial viability of this approach should be further explored with specific focus on high overtime usage agencies. 


##### Policy 3: Implementing a Performance-Based Pay Structure
* __Objective:__ Introduce a performance-based pay structure where employees are rewarded based on their performance, including task completion, complaints received, and response times.

* __Analysis:__
  * A sample employee dataset is used to create performance-based pay by introducing bonuses for task completion and penalties for complaints.
 
  * The total cost of payroll before and after implementing the performance-based pay structure is compared.
  
  * __Potential Savings:__ By adjusting compensation based on performance, savings are realized in the form of reduced pay for low-performing employees.
 
  * __Visualization:__ A boxplot is provided to visualize how compensation would change across agencies under the new pay structure.

__Recommendation:__ This policy could lead to some cost savings, particularly for underperforming employees. However, careful consideration of performance metrics and employee buy-in is needed to ensure effectiveness and fairness in the system.

#### __Summary of Findings and Recommendations__
 __Capping Salaries:__ Potential savings from capping salaries at the mayoral level could be substantial. However, the policy risks significant morale impacts among higher-paid employees. A balance between cost-saving and employee satisfaction should be considered.

 __Increasing Staffing:__ This proposal could reduce overtime-related expenses significantly, especially for agencies with the highest overtime usage. Further analysis is needed on the recruitment and training costs associated with increasing staffing levels.

 __Performance-Based Pay:__ Implementing a performance-based pay structure could encourage higher productivity but requires careful planning to ensure fairness and avoid unintended consequences, such as employee dissatisfaction.

#### __Conclusion:__
All three policy proposals offer potential solutions to manage NYCâ€™s growing payroll expenses. However, each comes with its own set of challenges and considerations. A detailed cost-benefit analysis, alongside employee feedback, will be crucial in selecting the most viable strategy. Further testing and pilot programs are recommended before widespread implementation.
